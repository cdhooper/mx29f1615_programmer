$0.1643 C20917 is AO3400A N-chan MOSFET 30V 5.7A
    ? $0.0339 C79015B BSS123 N-chan MOSFET 100V 170mA (not enough A?)
    ? $0.0210 C193019 BSS138 N-chan MOSFET 50V 220mA (not enough A?)
    ? $0.0232 C8545   2N7002 N-chan MOSFET 60V 115mA (not enough A?)
    No resolution -- couldn't find a basic part which is cheaper

$0.0634 C45783 is CL21A226MAQNNNE Samsung 22uF 0805 basic SMD cap
    NO $0.0094 C1729 Samsung 22nF 0805 50V basic SMD cap (min 50, large stock)
    No resolution -- this is the only 22uF basic part

BSS84 footprint is wrong, requiring JLCPCB to manually fix the part placement
    It appears JLCPCB has corrected the footprint for these parts.
    For future spins, must swap all BSS84 parts for new C8492 parts or
    update the footprints.

PA10 has VBUS pull-up, but it should be PA9
    Fixed in Rev5

Pad for PA15_TDI is too close to STM32 package
    Removed in Rev5

Remove Pad for PA15_TDI
    Removed in Rev5

USB-C cutout area too large -- could make the pads a little larger
    Fixed in Rev5

BOOT1 is pulled high instead of being pulled low
    Fixed in Rev5

PD5 does not need pull up/down
    Fixed in Rev5

PD6 should only be pulled low at startup
    Fixed in Rev5

Move INIT LED higher so it's not obscured by ZIF socket
    Fixed in Rev5

Add VCC active LED
    Fixed in Rev5

Add labeling to all bottom-side pins of the ZIF socket, SWD, console
    Fixed in Rev5

Board needs to be slightly less wide
    Fixed in Rev5
