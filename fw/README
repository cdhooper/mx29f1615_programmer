In order to build firmware, you will need to have the compiler and
libraries installed on your host.
    Fedora:
        sudo dnf install arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-newlib

To build using libopencm3, simply type:
    make

To send firmware to the programmer, there are two ways supported by the
Makefile.

A. ST-Link
    1. Connect the ST-Link to your MX29F1615 Programmer's STM32 SWD header.
    2. Connect the USB mini-B on your ST-Link to your build host.
    3. Connect the USB mini-B or USB type-C port on your MX29F1615 programmer
       to power (such as your build host).
    4. Enter the following command on your build host
        sudo make flash

B. DFU
    1. Connect the USB mini-B or USB type-C port on your MX29F1615 programmer
       to power (such as your build host).
    2. Hold down both the Abort button and the Reset button.
    3. Release the Reset button, and then the Abort button. You should see
       the Yellow INIT LED illuminate.
    4. Enter the following command on your build host
        sudo make dfu
